# prr_react
This is a an example of a table, using React, that can be put on a page in a rails app.
The goal is to provide basic components for the table that can be added, deleted and edited.

The table gets, creates and deletes, but does not update.

If you clone this, you will have to add your own secrets files.

To do: 
1. CSS to make it look a little better
2. Refactor UserTable object.  
  a. ajax calls could probably be consolidated
  b. some of the react components could be broken up into reusable components instead of elements
3. Update needs to be added.
